- Shlaer-Mellor:
    about: >
      Original methodology emphasizing execution semantics and platform independence with an emphasis
      on class/logic modeling foundations. Pre-dates UML.
    why use it: >
      Notation was optimized for fast easy hand drawing. Perfect for whiteboards and notes where UML
      is clunky. The UML was designed with the assumption that you would rarely if ever draw by hand.

- Starr:
    about: >
      Leon Starr adapted the Shlaer-Mellor and UML notations to minimize positioning operations
      when using a draw tool, such as OmniGraffle, that doesn't directly support these notations.
      For example, the '1..*' multiplicity phrases are replaced by arrow symbols so that you
      don't need to drag the text around each time you change the position of an arrow.
    why use it: >
      Easy to draw with a wide variety of non-UML diagramming tools. Less visual clutter.

- xUML:
    about: >
      AKA, Executable UML. Usage of UML to represent executable semantics
    why use it: >
      Standards conformance. You are presenting a diagram to an organziation where
      everyone knows, uses, or must use UML. Publishing to a wide audience.
      On the downside, a lot of extra graphics and text clutter is required to display
      a model with Shlaer-Mellor semantics. This is especially the case with a class diagram,
      but not so much with a state machine diagram.
