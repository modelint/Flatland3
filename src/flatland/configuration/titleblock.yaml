# titleblock.yaml â€“ Define unscaled titleblock structure

# Here you can create your own custom unscaled title block pattern
# See github wiki for an illustrated example under Sheet Subsystem

# No Metamodel elements are assigned here and the x,y coordinates of each rectangle
# in the pattern are not defined here
# This is just a scalable specification of the rectangular subdivisions, text styling
# and relative proportions in the Title Block Patterns

# The idea being that you can use the same pattern with a wide variety of Sheet sizes
# and have it scale automatically with the same internal proportions

      compartment boxes: # A container box that is divided horizontally or vertically
          # Example:
          # Box 1 is split horizontally with a divider 25% of its height moving up the y axis
          # This creates upper Box 2 and lower Box 3
          1: {Orientation: H, Distance: 0.25, Up: 2, Down: 3}
          2: {Orientation: V, Distance: 0.66, Right: 4, Left: 5}
          4: {Orientation: H, Distance: 0.5, Up: 6, Down: 7}
      data boxes: # Box that is not subdivided with metadata assignable in one or more regions
          # Example:
            # Box 3 named 'Bottom' (created by splitting Box 1, above) is defined with:
            # Text left and center aligned using the specified text style
            # A single region spans the interior so only one Metadata item may be assigned
          3 : {Name: Bottom, H align: LEFT, V align: CENTER, Style: Block body, Regions: 1}
          5 : {Name: Main, H align: LEFT, V align: CENTER, Style: Block title, Regions: 1}
          6 : {Name: Rtop, H align: LEFT, V align: CENTER, Style: Block body, Regions: 2}
          7 : {Name: Rbottom, H align: LEFT, V align: CENTER, Style: Block body, Regions: 2}

      # Name of title block pattern is a user supplied alphanumeric string with spaces or underscores permitted
      # ID is a unique integer >= one
      # Orientation is H / V
      # Distance is a rational number > 0 and < 1
      # Up, Down, Left, Right specifies ID of a new Partitioned Box
      # Name describes location or purpose of a Data Box (easier to remember than a number)
      # Alignment options are H: LEFT / RIGHT and V: TOP / CENTER / BOTTOM
      # Regions must be an integer >= one
      # Available style names are defined in the mi_tablet folder in your config directory

# Add custom title blocks below (or modify above at your own risk!)
